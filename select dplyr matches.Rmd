#Select dplyr NOTE Matches subfunction - see ?select

## select: Pick columns by name

* Base R approach is awkward to type and to read
* dplyr approach uses similar syntax to `filter`
* Like a SELECT in SQL

```{r results='hide'}
# base R approach to select DepTime, ArrTime, and FlightNum columns
flights[, c("DepTime", "ArrTime", "FlightNum")]
```

```{r}
# dplyr approach
select(flights, DepTime, ArrTime, FlightNum)

# use colon to select multiple contiguous columns, and use `contains` to match columns by name
# note: `starts_with`, `ends_with`, and `matches` (for regular expressions) can also be used to match columns by name
select(flights, Year:DayofMonth, contains("Taxi"), contains("Delay"))
```
